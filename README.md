## My process

I started this project by importing the fonts from Google Fonts, then began building the necessary HTML. Once the HTML was in place, I styled the webpage focusing first on the mobile design, then on the PC design. Because I was working with multiple font families, I defined them as custom variables on the root, to be called where needed.


### Built with

- HTML
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This is the first webpage I've created where I focused on designing for mobile. I learned how to style a responsive design that rearranges the content according to device width.


### Useful resources

- [How to Make a Website Responsive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYV6dYtz4HA) - I found this video tutorial to be extremely helpful for mobile-first design.
